# 🧪 Educational Blog with Next.js

This repository contains an **experimental blog built with Next.js**, created **exclusively for educational purposes**. It was developed as a personal lab to deeply explore the modern capabilities of the framework and test **advanced fullstack development patterns**.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is **not intended for production use**. It was built purely for learning, experimentation, and hands-on practice.

## 🚀 Technologies & Concepts Explored

### ⚛️ Next.js (13+ / App Router)

* **Server and Client Components**: clear separation for performance and modularity.
* **Server Actions**: secure and declarative server-side logic handling.
* **Dynamic Routes**: page generation based on route parameters like slugs.
* **Hybrid Rendering**: strategic use of **SSR** and **ISR** depending on context.

### 🧵 Modern React/Next Hooks

* `useTransition`: improves UX during async transitions.
* `useEffect`: for side effects in client components.
* `useActionState`: handles form states and async server mutations.

### 📦 Caching & Revalidation

* **`unstable_cache`**: async function caching with fine-grained control.
* **`revalidateTag`**: intelligent tag-based revalidation for optimized performance and data freshness.

### 🔐 Security & Best Practices

* **JWT-based Authentication**: secure session management.
* **Custom Middleware**: protects routes, validates headers and tokens.
* **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)**: ensures secure and structured data transfer between layers.

### 🧱 Project Architecture

* **Repository Pattern** for data access: separates business logic from persistence.
* Clean component separation with proper client/server boundaries.
* Modular and scalable structure.

### 📈 SEO & Optimization

* Dynamic metadata with `generateMetadata` per route.
* OpenGraph, custom titles, and descriptions for enhanced SEO.
* Automatic image optimization, lazy loading, and semantic HTML usage.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was designed as a **practical learning tool and experiment playground**. Rather than following a rigid standard, it explores a variety of Next.js capabilities — especially the newest features — testing real-world use cases and best practices.

It served as a way to **consolidate knowledge** while applying modern web development principles such as security, performance, scalable architecture, and fullstack integration.

---

## 🧪 Final Notes

* Code written with a strong focus on **clarity, security, organization, and performance**.
* Some architectural choices were intentionally made to **explore concepts**, even when simpler solutions existed.
* This project will likely continue evolving as new features are tested — always with an educational mindset.
